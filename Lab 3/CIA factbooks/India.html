            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended 
                into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their 
                merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 
                3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia.</p>
