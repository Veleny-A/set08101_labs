            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and 
                status with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence 
                of Brazil, its wealthiest colony, in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, and for most of the next six decades, 
                repressive governments ran the country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The 
                following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and 
                entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.</p>
