            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century 
                treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Dhabi, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - 
                merged to form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP 
                is on par with those of leading West European nations. For more than three decades, oil and global finance drove the 
                UAE's economy.</p>
